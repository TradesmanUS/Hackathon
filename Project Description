Project Description

We present an abstract account implementation that applies complex governance capabilities to 
USDC tokens.  The accounts are linked to Accumulate blockchain identities.  The extended multisig 
security model of Accumulate is then extended to the USDC account.  

Account security is controlled by hierarchical keypages with each keypage defining a security model 
such 2 out of 3 keys which allows for complex governance to be defined and enforced by 
the blockchain.   Applying keypages to USDC will support custody and other complex use cases.
