All the smart contracts are created on Citrea testnet. Citrea is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin-based zkRollup. 
During the demo or after demo, if Circle want us to move the SmartContracts to a EVM platform that your prefer or promote, we will be glad to do so. 

The Smart contract adresses are provided below.

The wallet will be avilable to be operate from AMLOnChain.com - that is operated by the wallet provide. 

Note: They are always releasing, sometimes the web site is down - contact Jon, if you are unable to test it on the wallet web site.
